# TrackPackageBot
Bot that let you track your packages 

## Idea

The idea of this project is to create a simple application that, starting from the tracking/delivery number/code, let you track the packages.

Our objective is to get around the use of different technologies like:

- Docker
- CI/CD through GitLab Actions
- Automate testing

## Notes

This a personal project developed with the help of a friend.
